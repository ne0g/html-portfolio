<h1>Movies To Keep You Gripped by Neil</h1>

<h2>Here's a list of my top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Predator</h3>
<p>
A fantastic Sci-Fi movie starring Arnold Schwarznegger in which an alien crash lands on the planet, hunting humans in the jungle.
</p>

<h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>
A gritty world war 2 drama starring Tom Hanks and many more familiar faces. 
It follows a squadron of soldiers on their mission to save Private Ryan from behind enemy lines. Very dramatic, action packed, and a testament to the era.
    <br/>
    <br/>
Recommended to watch this with a surround sound speaker system, as this will really bring out punchy sounds.
</p>

<h3>Hereditary</h3>
<p>
A slow burn horror that involves a family, a tragedy, and cults that deal in generational curses. 
This movie is hands down one of my favourite modern horrors, with moments that will have you questioning your own perceptions!
    <br/>
    <br/>
Definitely recommended to watch this one once the kids are asleep!

<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>

<h3>Mist</h3>
<p>
    After a government experiment gone wrong, a portal to a hellish realm has opened up in a sleepy town located in the mountains of the US of A!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also another horror, so consider watching with the lights off!
